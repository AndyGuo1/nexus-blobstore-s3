This repository is no longer maintained as the S3 implementation has been formally moved into the [Repository Manager 
codebase](https://github.com/sonatype/nexus-public/) as a supported feature. Upgrade to the latest version of Repository 
Manager to use S3 backed blob stores. Also, issues for this project have been disabled. To open new issues relating to 
S3 blob stores create a new issue in [JIRA](https://issues.sonatype.org).
